 == Contributing Guidelines == 
Looking to contribute something? Here's how you can help.

 == Bug reports == 

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

 == Guidelines for bug reports: == 

*Use the GitHub issue search — check if the issue has already been reported.*

*Check if the issue has been fixed — try to reproduce it using the latest master or development branch in the repository.*

*Isolate the problem — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example.*

*Please try to be as detailed as possible in your report. Include specific information about the environment - web host, PHP version, WordPress version, browser and version, operating system and version ... and steps required to reproduce the issue.*

 == Feature requests & contribution enquiries == 

Feature requests are welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case for the inclusion of your feature applicable to all sites. Please provide as much detail and context as possible.

Contribution enquiries should take place before any significant pull request, otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that we might have good reasons for rejecting.

 == Pull requests == 

*Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits.*

*Make sure to adhere to the WordPress coding conventions (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements (such as test coverage).*

**Please follow this process; it's the best way to get your work included in the project:**

*Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix:*

*Commit your changes in logical chunks. Provide clear and explanatory commit messages. Use git's interactive rebase feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.*

*Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:*

*Push your topic branch up to your fork:*

*Open a Pull Request with a clear title and description.*
